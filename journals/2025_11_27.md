- Woke up at like 5am again, wonder if that L-Theanine actually does help with being able to stay asleep because I didn't take it last nite. Then again it could have to do with the restless child in my bed. She definitely moves around a lot. Just spent a few hours taking care of all the game stuff, then back to language learning. I feel like I've nearly made up my mind to force myself to start on Portuguese even though a Celtic, Slavic, or Finnic language looks shiny and new.
  
  Meara woke up around 8 and was ready to go. Glad she got close to 8 hours.
