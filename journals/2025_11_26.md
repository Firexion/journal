- Woke up from Jack making noise around 6:45 but it was right before my alarm was gonna go off anyways so I just took care of some game stuff and then got the kids up. So hungry for some reason. Meant to get food as soon as they left but instead just sat in bed watching a little anime and doing a bit of research. 
  
  After a bit Ed came in and got ready to head out. He was gonna head to the book store to pick up a new journal and then go to Walmart to pick up his scripts. Was a bit sad he didn't invite me but I think he just wanted some time to himself. I just get maybe a bit jealous cause it feels like it's always someone else who gets to go out with him. It used to be Winry. He literally could not leave the house without her before. And now it's Al, though at least Al doesn't throw a hissy fit
